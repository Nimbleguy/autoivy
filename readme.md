# AutoIvy
Builds, runs, and downloads dependancies for java projects using ivy and make. Edit Makefile to change src directory, bin directory, and library directory, as well as output jar and arguments.
Edit libs.conf to add other maven download repositories. There are two examples commented out.
You may need to edit ivysettings.xml for things like extra artifacts.
